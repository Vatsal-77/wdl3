		<td>iPhone 12 and 12 Mini camera features Both the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini sport a dual-camera setup on the back. They have a 12MP ultra wide-angle lens with ƒ/2.4 aperture and a 12MP wide-angle lens with ƒ/1.6 aperture. The camera allows for a 27% improvement in low-light photography. .</td>
		<td>5G speed. A14 Bionic, the fastest chip in a smartphone.
An edge-to-edge OLED display. Ceramic Shield with four times better drop performance. And Night mode on every camera. iPhone 12 has it all — in two perfect sizes. </td>
		<td>According to these filings, the ‌iPhone 12‌ mini will have a battery capacity 883mAh smaller than the ‌iPhone 11‌, and the ‌iPhone 12‌ will have a capacity 335mAh smaller than the ‌iPhone 11‌. Even the ‌iPhone 12 Pro‌ suffers from a battery capacity 271mAh smaller than the ‌iPhone 11‌ Pro, and the ‌iPhone 12 Pro‌ Max has a capacity 282mAh smaller than the ‌iPhone 11 Pro Max‌. Other rumors have suggested that the ‌iPhone 12 Pro‌ may have a larger capacity of 2,815mAh, but this is still less than the 3,046 of the ‌iPhone 11‌ Pro. Overall, it appears that all ‌iPhone 12‌ models will likely be subject to a battery capacity smaller than their predecessors.</td>

		<td>The OnePlus 8T gets a new quad-camera system at the back. Although OnePlus says it is new, 80 percent of the components are over a year older. It uses the same 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 sensor for the primary lens, a 16-megapixel camera for the ultra-wide lens, and a 2-megapixel monochrome camera. OnePlus says this monochrome camera activates in the B&W filter mode of the camera app.  The macro camera from the OnePlus 8 is now upgraded to 5-megapixels.</td>
		<td>Thumping inside the Aquamarine Green body is the Snapdragon 865 chip, which is the same chip from the OnePlus 8. This is paired with up to 12GB LPDDR4X RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. The RAM isn’t of the fastest type but this is a killer combination for performance seekers.</td>
		<td>OnePlus is utilizing the twin-battery technology from Oppo to offer the 65W fast charging on the 8T. OnePlus claims 40 minutes of average time to fill up the battery from dead, which is slightly longer than the same on Oppo phones. It works as advertised and on the daily run, it comes across as extremely convenient to spend lesser time at the sockets. The Warp Charge 65 adapter now uses a USB-C to USB-C cable. Additionally, the 8T also supports 27W of fast charging with fast chargers of other make.</td>

		<td>An amazing camera experience was never going to be high on the propriety list of a gaming smartphone. Even so, Asus has been consistently delivering perfectly adequate camera setups on the ROG Phone line. The ROG Phone 3 is no exception. Its main camera is, more or less, an incremental update over the one in the ROG Phone II. It uses the popular 64MP, Quad-Bayer Sony IMX686 sensor. It's a 1/1.7" unit, with 0.8 µm individual pixels and 2x1 OCL PDAF, sitting behind an f/1.8 lens. Nothing too glamorous or spectacular. There is no OIS, Laser AF and just a simple one-LED flash setup. Even so, the Sony IMX686 has proven its salt as a capable shooter.</td>
		<td>ROG Phone 3 is the most powerful gaming phone to use the latest Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 865 Plus 5G Mobile Platform with advanced 5G mobile communications capabilities. Built to satisfy even the most hardcore gamer, it has an amazing new 144 Hz / 1 ms display that leaves the competition standing. </td>
		<td>The Asus ROG Phone 3 houses a gargantuan 6,000mAh battery which is one of the largest on the market to date, and with good reason. The handset packs in a powerhouse Snapdragon 865 Plus processor, a zippy 144Hz AMOLED display, and is tasked with keeping gamers juiced up for those long play sessions.</td>
